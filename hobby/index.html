<span class="headline">Paddleboarding</span>
<p>
<img src="img/paddleboarding.jpg" class="spotart" alt="girl paddleboarding." />A few years ago, a free paddleboard yoga class was held on the riverwalk in my town. A friend and I went and that is when I fell in love with paddleboarding. That year for my birthday I got my own paddleboard. </p>

<p>I love the satisfaction of being out on the water and having to balance. It's fun to be able to explore new places. We moved here in March and I couldn't wait to get on the water with my paddleboard. This summer I did a 1 hour paddle tour down the Columbia river. I had never even met the women on the tour but we were instant friends over our love of paddleboarding. </p>
