<img src="img/paddleboarding.jpg" class="spotart" alt="girl paddleboarding." />A few years ago, a free paddleboard yoga class was held on the riverwalk in my town. A friend and I went and that is when I fell in love with paddleboarding. I even managed to do a handstand on my board (even if only for a few seconds). That year for my birthday I got my own paddleboard. </p>

<p>I love the satisfaction of being out on the water and having to balance. It's fun to be able to explore new places. Sometimes I like to just lay down and float, staring up at the sky. My kids enjoy riding along sometimes. </p>
	
<p>We moved to eastern Washington in March and I couldn't wait to get on the water with my paddleboard. This summer I did a 1 hour paddle tour down the Columbia river. I had never even met the women on the tour but we were instant friends over our love of paddleboarding.</p>
